# Linear-Regression-EX

Python: 
Using sklearn and scipy library, I created a simple example how to obtain a simple linear regression model and
mutiple linear regression model. Simple linear regression was to see the trend between chance of admission into graduate 
school and GRE scores. Mutiple linear regression was to check if other variables may help or harm chance of admission
into graduate school.
